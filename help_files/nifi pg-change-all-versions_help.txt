## nifi pg-change-all-versions

Changes the version for all of the controlled process group instances for a
given flow ID. This can be used to upgrade all the instances of a versioned flow
to a new version, or revert to a previous version. If no version is specified,
the latest version will be used. If no process group ID is provided, the root
process group will be used to recursively search for all instances of the Flow
ID. It is possible to force the recursive operation and not stop the operation
in case the upgrade of a process group fails.
