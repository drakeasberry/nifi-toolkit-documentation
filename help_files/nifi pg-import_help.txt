## nifi pg-import

Creates a new process group by importing a versioned flow from a registry. If no
process group id is specified, then the created process group will be placed in
the root group. If only one registry client exists in NiFi, then it does not
need to be specified and will be automatically selected. The x and y coordinates
for the position of the imported process group may be optionally specified. If
left blank, the position will automatically be selected to avoid overlapping
with existing process groups.
