## registry sync-flow-versions

Syncs the versions of a flow to another flow, which could be in a different
bucket or registry. This command assumes the intent is to maintain the exact
version history across the two flows. The list of versions from the source flow
will be compared to the destination flow, and any versions not present will be
added. If --sourceProps is not provided then the source registry will be assumed
to be the same as the destination registry.
